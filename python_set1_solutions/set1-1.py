'''
1.Write a program that examines three variablesâ€”x, y, and zâ€” and prints the largest odd number among them.
 If none of them are odd, it should print a message to that effect.

a=int(input("enter a number:\n"))
b=int(input("enter another number:\n"))
c=int(input("enter third number:\n"))
if a%2==0:
